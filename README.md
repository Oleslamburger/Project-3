# Data Engineering Track - Overview of the project and its purpose
Our project revolves around providing valuable insights into vehicle safety. We aggregate and analyze complaint data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) database, aiming to empower consumers, researchers, and policymakers with comprehensive information about vehicle safety issues.

We employed covert web scraping techniques to extract safety rating data from NHTSA's web pages, revealing insights for a wide range of vehicle models. The extracted data, including safety ratings and complaints, is stored in an SQLite database. SQLite, chosen for its simplicity and seamless integration with Python, provides an efficient solution for storing and retrieving safety-related data.In addition to the core functionalities of our project, we've integrated a robust data visualization component to enhance the user experience and provide clearer insights. This addition allows users to interact with the data in a more visually appealing and comprehensible manner.

The core of our project lies in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows, where raw data undergoes transformation. The ETL script extracts and transforms data from the web before loading it into the SQLite database, enhancing data integrity and usability.



## At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project
All data was collected from the NHTSA website according and followed the NHTSAâ€™s terms of use. The NHTSA is a government website and all information collected was public. Since the data was all collected in regards to vehicles, their ratings, recalls, and complaints, in nature, the data does not infringe on personal privacy nor does it exhibit algorithmic bias.

## Documentation of the database used and why (e.g. benefits of SQL or NoSQL for this project)
SQLite was selected as the database solution for its pragmatic attributes that align with the project's requirements. Its serverless architecture and minimal configuration demands simplify the implementation process. The single-file storage format enhances portability, enabling easy project sharing and deployment. SQLite's efficiency in managing small to medium-sized datasets is well-suited for the project's focus on vehicle safety data. The native support for Python through the `sqlite3` module facilitates seamless ETL workflows, contributing to the overall project efficiency.In summary, SQLite is chosen for its simplicity, efficiency, and seamless integration, offering a practical and effective solution for the storage and retrieval of safety-related data in this project.
